This project was made with the Tiva TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller, EDUBase ARM Trainer board, and Putty. To run game load 
the frogger.c, frogger.s, and tm4c123gh6pm_startup_ccs.c (startup code) in Code Composer Studio, as well as connect your Tiva TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller.  This game replicates the Frogger game
made in 1981.  The frog is represented as '&' and the goal is to reach the openings in the top of the board.  There is a time 
limit, everytime you reach the frog into any 2 of 4 bases at the top of the board you will receive points and additional time.
Flys are represented as '+' and will receive 150 points for eating one with a your frog. Collision with Cars('C'), 
trucks('###'), river('~'), Alligator head('A'), and walls('|' or '*') will result in a lost life.
